Um, I never was as close to him as I was my father. But I mean, I felt like that we were friends anyway. Uh, however, we did kind of go sour when my mother passed away. Uh, I'm not gonna even go into all that. It's a long story. But let's just say I had some, um, some bitterness about things that happened when she passed and she passed away in October of last year. Well, after she passed away, he became sick with COVID and then he had to have surgery and he was in the hospital for about a month and a half total. And I really tried to set aside my feelings and help him out because he really didn't have anybody else in the world. All his other family is gone. And, um, anyway, I felt like I was just gonna go ahead and keep trying to take care of him as much as possible. However, three months after my mother passed away, he called me one day to tell me he just married this woman and it's a woman who is 70 years old and he's 85. So, um, of course, I know exactly why she wanted to marry him more than likely. It's because she wants to get the house and this is a house that my father paid for. But, you know, that's all here. That's neither here or there. But my whole thing is I felt like it was such a disrespect, not only to the fact that my mother just passed away three months before, but he didn't introduce this woman to me or any of my other family and it just felt very disrespectful and like he didn't really care about us at all. So, um, the thing is he is my son's grandfather and he is contacting me like, well, why don't you ever come see me anymore?

In my role as a wide marketing coordinator, I am responsible for ensuring fair and legal practices in the market place.

The pros for me moving into the the other house is that it would allow me to take care of another person that needs taken care of and it would lower my current expenses to live there. The problem is that I have a disability that affects my mobility. And if I move to this other house, I will have to go up some very steep stairs to get to my room and that will be very difficult for me. I also need to do major renovations on several rooms in that house before it'll be liable for me. And that will cost me thousands and thousands of dollars. And I'm living on a limited budget right now. If I go ahead and do this and use all that money to make the repairs to the other house, I could be very happy living there. But if something happens to the person who actually owns the house, I could be forced to leave and then lose everything. There's a possibility though that if anything happens to the owner of that house, I may be able to take over the mortgage, but the amount that the mortgage costs is extremely expensive, I could probably afford it, but I'm not positive.
