Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I appreciate the thought, but it's hard to see the silver lining right now. I put in so much effort, and it feels like it just went unnoticed. It's frustrating to think that all my hard work might not be enough.
Supporter: It always hurts when things like this happen but I promise you it will get better. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I know things might improve eventually, but right now it just feels like a huge setback. It's tough to stay motivated when it seems like my efforts aren't being valued. I just wish I knew what more I could do to be seen and appreciated for my work.
Supporter: Why don't you ask management if there's more that you can be doing. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I get where you're coming from, but it feels like I've already been doing so much. It's just disheartening to think that I need to do even more to be recognized. I guess I'm just trying to figure out if it's worth it to keep pushing myself like this.
Supporter: You have to push to do better because then you'll have motivation when another opportunity arises. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I understand the idea of staying motivated for future opportunities, but it's hard to keep pushing when it feels like my efforts aren't being acknowledged now. I just wish there was a way to know that what I'm doing is actually making a difference. It's tough to keep giving my all when I'm not sure if it even matters.
Supporter: I think everyone feels that way about their job. That's why we set high standards for ourselves. Because even if others don't notice our hard work we notice it ourselves. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I get that, and I do try to hold myself to high standards. But sometimes it feels like I'm just running in circles without any real progress. I just wish there was more acknowledgment from those who have the power to make a difference in my career.
Supporter: Maybe you should find a different work environment. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I’ve thought about that, but it’s not an easy decision to make. I’ve invested a lot in this company, and I really believed in the work we were doing. It’s just hard to know if leaving is the right move or if I should keep trying to make it work here.
","Step 1: Example — ""It always hurts when things like this happen...""

Step 2: Justification — This statement acknowledges the pain and hurt the seeker is experiencing, validating their negative emotions related to being passed over for a promotion.  The phrase ""things like this happen"" implies that this type of disappointment is a common and understandable experience, further normalizing the seeker's feelings.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — Why don't you ask management if there's more that you can be doing?

Step 2: Justification — This question, while intending to be helpful, doesn't encourage elaboration on the seeker's feelings of discouragement and lack of recognition. Instead, it shifts the focus to a solution-oriented approach without fully acknowledging the seeker's emotional state.  It implies the problem is a lack of effort, rather than a lack of recognition for existing effort.

Step 3: Score — 2","Step 1: Example — ""Why don't you ask management if there's more that you can be doing.""

Step 2: Justification — This statement directly suggests a course of action for the seeker to take (""ask management"").  It's unsolicited because the seeker hasn't asked for advice on how to improve their situation with management; they're expressing feelings of discouragement and lack of recognition. The supporter is offering a solution without first fully understanding or validating the seeker's feelings.  The subsequent suggestions to ""push to do better"" and ""Maybe you should find a different work environment"" further exemplify this pattern of unsolicited advice.

Step 2: Justification — Instead of directly addressing the seeker's feelings of discouragement and lack of recognition, the supporter shifts the conversation to their own experiences and perspective on job satisfaction and high standards.  The statement generalizes the seeker's specific situation, minimizing the unique challenges they are facing.

Supporter: Being on autopilot 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Yeah, it's like I'm stuck in this loop and can't find the exit. I keep thinking there must be a way to reconnect with what really matters, but it's hard to see the path forward when everything feels so overwhelming. Do you ever feel like you're just missing out on the important moments?
Supporter: Yes all the time!

Seeker: It's comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. Sometimes I wonder if it's possible to find a balance between work and personal life without sacrificing one for the other. Do you have any strategies that help you stay connected to what truly matters?
Supporter: I prioritize in my head. I remind myself constantly. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That sounds like a good approach. I try to remind myself too, but sometimes it feels like the reminders get lost in the chaos. How do you keep those priorities front and center when things get hectic?
Supporter: I just keep tunnel vision and stay focused 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I admire your ability to stay focused like that. I find it challenging to maintain that kind of tunnel vision when everything feels like it's pulling me in different directions. Do you ever struggle with feeling like you're missing out on other aspects of life while staying so focused?
Supporter: Yes I do because I also have a tendency to focus rather hard on things that hold no weight 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I can relate to that. Sometimes I get so caught up in work that I lose sight of what truly matters, and it feels like I'm missing out on the little joys. It's reassuring to know I'm not the only one who struggles with this balance.
Supporter: You definitely aren't the only one. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know that others are navigating similar challenges. I guess it's about finding ways to remind ourselves of what truly matters, even when it's tough.
Supporter: Everyone's life experience is subjective. Just follow what matters to you. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That's true, and I appreciate the reminder. It's just hard sometimes to figure out what truly matters when everything feels so urgent. I guess it's a journey of figuring it out as we go along.
Supporter: That's the fun part 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I suppose it can be, though it doesn't always feel that way in the moment. Maybe it's about finding those small moments of joy and clarity amidst the chaos. It's reassuring to think that even in the struggle, there's room for growth and discovery.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — I prioritize in my head. I remind myself constantly.

Step 2: Justification — Although the supporter is sharing their personal coping mechanism,  it's presented as a solution or strategy for the seeker's problem.

The supporter expresses sympathy but doesn't truly engage with the depth of the seeker's emotional experience.  The response is more of a platitude than a genuine attempt to understand and validate the seeker's feelings.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""ugh i'm so sorry, you were working so hard to get that""

Step 2: Justification — While not a direct question, this response acknowledges the seeker's feelings and implicitly encourages them to elaborate on their experience of working hard and not receiving the promotion.  The empathetic statement creates a safe space for the seeker to share more details about their disappointment and the effort they invested.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""I totally get that, it's hard to not think about something happening that is totally beyond your control.""

Step 2: Justification — This statement directly reflects the seeker's feeling of frustration and helplessness in a situation where the outcome is beyond their control.  The supporter acknowledges the seeker's experience of feeling that their efforts aren't being valued, even though the reasons might be outside of their direct influence. This is a clear paraphrase of the seeker's expressed feelings.

Step 2: Justification — This statement offers a prediction about the future and implies that the seeker's hard work will inevitably be recognized, even if it hasn't been yet.  It's unsolicited because the seeker hasn't asked for a prediction or reassurance about future opportunities, but rather is expressing current feelings of discouragement and questioning their efforts.  The supporter is imposing their belief on the seeker rather than validating the seeker's feelings.

Step 2: Justification — These statements offer solutions and interpretations of the situation without the seeker explicitly asking for them. The supporter is speculating about the reasons for the promotion denial and suggesting a course of action (asking for feedback, considering leaving the job) before the seeker has fully processed their feelings or explored their own options.  The second statement, in particular, jumps to a conclusion (""this place isn't the right fit"") and offers a rather definitive solution (""move on to bigger & better things"") without acknowledging the seeker's potential attachment to the job or the emotional toll of leaving.

This is unsolicited advice because the seeker hasn't asked for medical or therapeutic recommendations.  The supporter's sharing of their personal experience with medication, while well-intentioned, is still a form of unsolicited advice as it steers the conversation towards a specific solution before fully understanding the seeker's needs and preferences.

Step 2: Justification — While intending to be encouraging, this response doesn't directly prompt the seeker to elaborate on their feelings.  It offers a solution and minimizes the current negative feelings, rather than exploring them.  It's not a question designed to elicit further information about the seeker's emotional state or experience.

Step 2: Justification — This response acknowledges the seeker's feeling of frustration and disappointment (""it sucks"") while also attempting to offer a broader perspective on setbacks in life.  It doesn't directly paraphrase the seeker's words, but it reflects the core emotion of feeling undervalued and that hard work didn't result in the expected outcome.  The supporter is trying to connect with the feeling of unfairness.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — “You just need to pivot those efforts to a different avenue, focus that skill somewhere where people will appreciate it and will notice how unfair you were treated.”

Step 2: Justification — This statement directly advises the seeker on how to react to the situation (pivoting their efforts elsewhere).  It doesn't acknowledge the seeker's feelings of discouragement and unfairness, instead immediately offering a solution without exploring the seeker's emotional state.  The advice is unsolicited, as the seeker is expressing a need for emotional validation, not practical solutions.  The subsequent suggestions to focus on self-pride and letting go also fall under unsolicited advice, pushing a specific coping mechanism without considering the seeker's preferences.

Step 2: Justification — The supporter's responses remain focused on the seeker's situation, offering suggestions and perspectives related to the seeker's experience of being passed over for a promotion.  While the advice may be perceived as minimizing the seeker's feelings, it doesn't involve the supporter sharing personal anecdotes or experiences to shift the conversation's focus.

Instead of acknowledging the hurt and disappointment, the supporter offers a generic, somewhat dismissive reassurance about future opportunities.  The focus shifts away from the seeker's immediate emotional pain to a more generalized, future-oriented perspective, failing to validate their current experience.

Step 2: Justification — This response directly addresses the seeker's feeling of being overwhelmed by the promotion and questioning their life choices.

This is a paraphrase that shows understanding without minimizing the feeling.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — Would you like me to help you brainstorm some paths forward?

Step 2: Justification — Although the supporter frames this as a question, offering to brainstorm solutions is a form of unsolicited advice.  The seeker hasn't explicitly asked for problem-solving; they've expressed a need to process their feelings first.  The offer to brainstorm interrupts that process and pushes the conversation towards a solution-oriented approach before the seeker is ready.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""I understand. I would feel the same way.""

Step 2: Justification — This statement, while intending to offer validation, subtly shifts the focus from the seeker's feelings to the supporter's presumed feelings.  The supporter is not directly relating a personal experience, but implies a shared emotional state, making the conversation less about the seeker's unique situation and more about a generalized feeling.  The focus is shifted, even if unintentionally, to the supporter's capacity for empathy rather than the seeker's experience.

Instead of validating the seeker's specific feelings of detachment, overwhelm, and questioning life choices, the supporter shifts the focus to their own hypothetical feelings.

By acknowledging the seeker's feeling of discouragement and asking for clarification, the supporter shows they are listening and attempting to understand the root of the emotion.

Step 3: Score — 2","Step 1: Example — ""Be honest, can you change your race, if not then this job may not be right for you.""

Step 2: Justification — This statement directly advises the seeker to leave their job because they cannot change their race.  It's unsolicited because the seeker expressed feeling undervalued and questioning whether race played a role, not that they were actively considering leaving their job. The advice is dismissive of the seeker's feelings and focuses on a superficial solution rather than addressing the underlying issues of feeling undervalued and potentially facing racial bias.

Step 2: Justification —Instead of focusing on the seeker's feelings of discouragement and questioning of potential bias, the supporter steers the conversation towards their own interpretations and assumptions.  The questions are leading and push the seeker to focus on external factors (race) rather than exploring the seeker's internal experience of feeling undervalued.

The first example, while framed as a joke, still steers the seeker towards a specific (inappropriate) action. The other examples directly suggest taking time off, implying it's the best course of action without fully understanding the seeker's constraints or preferences.

Step 2: Justification — While the supporter attempts to reframe the situation, the phrase ""It's totally okay to vent though I totally get it"" acknowledges and validates the seeker's feelings of disappointment and frustration.  The supporter shows empathy by relating to the seeker's experience (""I've been there before"").  This demonstrates understanding and acceptance of the seeker's emotional state, even if the subsequent advice is somewhat dismissive.

Step 2: Justification — While this response doesn't directly ask a question, the phrase ""It's totally okay to vent though I totally get it""  implicitly encourages the seeker to elaborate on their feelings and experiences related to the promotion setback.  The supporter acknowledges the seeker's emotions and creates space for further expression before gently suggesting a shift in perspective.

Step 2: Justification — While not a direct paraphrase, the supporter acknowledges the seeker's feelings (""It's totally okay to vent, I totally get it"") and then attempts to reframe the situation by suggesting a positive interpretation (""These are the types of situations that build perseverance""). This shows an attempt to understand the seeker's perspective, even if the reframe might not be entirely helpful at that moment.

Step 3: Score — 2","Step 1: Example — ""No worries, you can try again. Keep your head up and you'll be rewarded eventually for your hard work.""

Step 2: Justification — This is unsolicited advice because the seeker is expressing feelings of discouragement and disappointment, not asking for strategies on how to cope with the situation or how to get a promotion. The supporter interrupts the emotional processing by immediately offering a solution (""try again"").  The advice is also generic and doesn't address the seeker's specific concerns about feeling overlooked.

The supporter is prescribing a coping mechanism (""take a breather"") without acknowledging the validity of the seeker's emotional response to the situation. The statement about not investing too much effort is also a judgment on the seeker's actions.

Step 2: Justification —  While the supporter acknowledges the seeker's feelings (""totally okay to vent""), they immediately follow it with more unsolicited advice (""try not to wallow"").  The attempt to reframe the situation as ""character-building"" is dismissive of the seeker's current emotional state.

Step 2: Justification — This statement directly acknowledges and validates the seeker's feelings of struggle and isolation.

This helps the seeker feel less alone and judged.

The phrase ""I feel that way all of the time"" shows empathy and shared experience, while the follow-up question demonstrates a desire to further understand the situation's complexities.  It's not a perfect paraphrase, but it captures the essence of the seeker's emotional state and invites further exploration.

This implicitly validates the feeling by not dismissing it as irrational or unimportant.

However, it does so in a way that is dismissive and doesn't fully capture the seeker's emotional state.

It frames the seeker's options as a choice between ""wasting time and energy"" or doing the bare minimum, implicitly pushing them towards the latter without fully understanding the seeker's nuanced feelings and priorities.  The supporter is not reflecting the seeker's feelings or offering validation; instead, they are imposing their own judgment on the situation.  Further instances of unsolicited advice include suggesting the seeker ""just do the bare minimum until you aren't disheartened anymore"" and ""You might just need to accept that fact"" (that they are undervalued).

Step 2: Justification — This response directly reflects the seeker's expressed feelings of loss and hurt related to their job loss and years of invested work.

Step 2: Justification — This question, while seemingly innocuous, pushes the seeker towards a specific action (job hunting) before they've had a chance to fully process their emotions and explore their options.  It interrupts the seeker's emotional processing and steers them toward a solution before they've had the space to determine if that's the right solution for them at this moment.  The advice is unsolicited because the seeker hasn't indicated a readiness to discuss job applications yet; they're still grappling with the initial shock and emotional fallout of losing their job.

While offering a relatable experience isn't inherently bad, in this context, it shifts the focus from the seeker's feelings and concerns to the supporter's own, interrupting the flow of the seeker's emotional processing. The follow-up question about the seeker's position also subtly redirects the conversation towards practicalities rather than emotional support.

Seeker: I think you're right; I probably am being too hard on myself. It's just tough to switch off that part of my brain that's always planning and worrying. Maybe giving myself permission to take a break is exactly what I need right now.
Supporter: it certainly does sound like something that you need to do? Maybe get away for a day or two? Talk to some former colleagues?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That might be a good idea. A change of scenery could help clear my mind, and catching up with some former colleagues might give me a fresh perspective. It's nice to think about doing something for myself for a change.
Supporter: I can tell from this conversation that you're very intelligent and perhaps you are too logical, getting away for a day or two might do you some good?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Thank you for saying that. I think you're right; stepping away for a bit could help me reset and maybe even spark some new ideas. It's just about giving myself permission to do it without feeling guilty.
Supporter: Why would you feel guilty? You haven't done anything wrong have you? Giving yourself a break and taking care of yourself is a very good idea.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I guess it's just that nagging feeling of needing to be productive all the time. It's hard to shake off the guilt of not doing something ""useful,"" even when I know taking care of myself is important. But you're right, I need to remind myself that it's okay to take a step back.
Supporter: I'm glad you agree with me and if you don't take care of yourself, who will? Even if there's other people who depend on you, still have to take care of yourself so that you don't get burnt out,?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That's a good point. I guess I've always been the one to take care of others, so it's a bit of a shift to focus on myself. But I know it's necessary, and I appreciate the reminder that it's okay to prioritize my own well-being.
Supporter: Yes sometimes prioritizing your own well-being has to come first. I agree, even if you feel shocked and disoriented right now, give yourself time to process what is happening you will feel better I'm sure.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I hope so. It's reassuring to hear that it's okay to take this time for myself. I just need to keep reminding myself that it's a process and that it's okay to not have all the answers right now.
","Step 1: Example — ""I can understand why you would feel that way...""

Step 2: Justification — This response acknowledges the seeker's feelings of being overwhelmed as valid and understandable, thereby validating their emotional experience.  The supporter doesn't dismiss or minimize the feelings but shows empathy by recognizing the situation's emotional impact.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""Would you like to talk more about it?""

Step 2: Justification — This open-ended question directly invites the seeker to elaborate on their feelings and experiences related to losing their job.  It doesn't interrupt or steer the conversation, but rather encourages the seeker to share at their own pace and in their own words.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""I can understand why you would feel that way...""

Step 2: Justification — This statement directly reflects the seeker's expressed feelings of being overwhelmed and unsure of what to do next.  The supporter isn't just acknowledging the situation; they're showing they grasp the emotional weight of the job loss.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""Yes I can understand how you feel. It's always shocking when you lose your job. Would you like to talk more about it?""

Step 2: Justification — Although the supporter begins by validating the seeker's feelings, the statement ""It's always shocking when you lose your job"" is unsolicited advice, implying a universal experience and potentially minimizing the seeker's unique emotional response.  The immediate follow-up question about talking more about it, while seemingly open-ended, still subtly steers the conversation towards a specific direction.

Step 3: Score — 2


Step 1: Example — ""That's a very good idea, take a couple of days off or whatever you need to process these emotions. Are you willing to do this? I have been fired as well, very demoralizing feeling.""

Step 2: Justification —  The supporter suggests taking a couple of days off, which is unsolicited advice. While sharing a personal experience adds empathy, the suggestion itself is not directly requested and could be perceived as presumptive.

Step 3: Score — 3


Step 1: Example — ""ell until you come to the decision about what your next step should be, may I suggest putting it on the back burner? Will you give yourself a break or are you being too hard on yourself?""

Step 2: Justification — This is a clear instance of unsolicited advice. The supporter directly suggests putting the job search ""on the back burner"" and questions whether the seeker is being too hard on themselves, offering solutions without fully understanding the seeker's needs or preferences.

Step 3: Score — 4


Step 1: Example — ""I can tell from this conversation that you're very intelligent and perhaps you are too logical, getting away for a day or two might do you some good?""

Step 2: Justification — While seemingly complimentary, this statement subtly implies the seeker is ""too logical"" and needs to escape their logic, which is an unsolicited assessment and suggestion for a solution.

Step 3: Score — 3


Step 1: Example — ""Why would you feel guilty? You haven't done anything wrong have you? Giving yourself a break and taking care of yourself is a very good idea.""

Step 2: Justification — This is unsolicited advice disguised as a question. The supporter challenges the seeker's feelings of guilt, offering a solution (""giving yourself a break"") without fully exploring the root of the guilt.

Step 3: Score — 3

Step 1: Example — ""Yes sometimes prioritizing your own well-being has to come first. I agree, even if you feel shocked and disoriented right now, give yourself time to process what is happening you will feel better I'm sure.""

Step 2: Justification — This is another instance of unsolicited advice.  While validating the seeker's feelings, the supporter again directly advises prioritizing well-being and assures them they will feel better, which is a prediction, not a guarantee.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""I have been fired as well, very demoralizing feeling.""

Step 2: Justification — Instead of focusing on the seeker's experience of job loss, the supporter inserts their own experience of job loss, thus shifting the conversation's focus from the seeker's feelings to their own.  The supporter's statement is intended to offer relatability, but it inadvertently centers the conversation on their own emotions and experience.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""Yes I can understand how you feel. It's always shocking when you lose your job. Would you like to talk more about it?""

Step 2: Justification — This response, while seemingly validating, minimizes the seeker's unique emotional experience by implying that job loss is a universally understood and uniformly shocking experience.  It doesn't acknowledge the nuances of the seeker's feelings (relief mixed with fear, for example) and quickly moves to a solution-oriented approach (""Would you like to talk more about it?"") before fully acknowledging the emotional weight of the situation.  The focus shifts too rapidly from empathy to problem-solving.

Supporter: 
Seeker: It's just been a lot lately. Work has been so demanding since the promotion, and I feel like I'm constantly on edge trying to keep up. Meanwhile, I can't shake the guilt of not being there for my family as much as I want to be.
Supporter: Aw, that sucks! I definitely can see why you feel that way, hows the family feeling about it?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's been tough on them too. My spouse is trying to be supportive, but I can tell they're feeling the strain, and the kids keep asking when I'll be home. It's hard not to feel like I'm letting them down.
Supporter: How much working have you been doing?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I've been working late most nights and even on weekends sometimes. It feels like there's always something urgent that needs my attention, and it's hard to find a moment to just breathe. I know it's not sustainable, but I don't know how to step back without feeling like I'm failing at work.
Supporter: That definitely makes sense, I'm sorry you're feeling this way and I hope it gets on course soon, you just need to find a balance
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I appreciate that, but finding balance feels like such a distant goal right now. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle and don't know how to break free. I just wish I could see a way forward that doesn't involve sacrificing either my career or my family.
Supporter: Don't worry, it's normal to feel like you may never find a balance during times like this, but rest assured you will
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I hope so. It's just hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when everything feels so overwhelming. I guess I just need to find a way to take it one step at a time.
Supporter: Yep, one step at a time, one day at a time :)
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Thank you for saying that. I think I need to remind myself that it's okay to take things slowly and not have everything figured out right away. It helps to know that I'm not alone in feeling this way.
","Step 1: Example — ""Aw, that sucks! I definitely can see why you feel that way, how's the family feeling about it?""

Step 2: Justification — The phrase ""I definitely can see why you feel that way"" directly acknowledges and validates the seeker's feelings of stress and guilt.  The supporter isn't dismissing or minimizing the situation; instead, they show understanding and empathy by recognizing the reason behind the seeker's emotional state.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""Aw, that sucks! I definitely can see why you feel that way, how's the family feeling about it?""

Step 2: Justification — This response acknowledges the seeker's feelings (""that sucks"") and then directly asks a follow-up question to encourage them to elaborate on the impact of their situation on their family.  It shows empathy and a desire to understand the full scope of the problem.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""Aw, that sucks! I definitely can see why you feel that way, how's the family feeling about it?""

Step 2: Justification — This response directly acknowledges the negative feelings expressed by the seeker (""that sucks"").  The phrase ""I definitely can see why you feel that way"" shows the supporter is attempting to understand the seeker's perspective based on the described situation (overwork, guilt, and lack of time with family).  While not a direct paraphrase of the seeker's exact words, it reflects the core emotional content and reasons behind the seeker's feelings of being overwhelmed.  The follow-up question about the family's feelings demonstrates a further attempt to understand the broader context of the situation.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""That definitely makes sense, I'm sorry you're feeling this way and I hope it gets on course soon, you just need to find a balance""

Step 2: Justification — This statement offers a solution (""find a balance"") without fully understanding the seeker's situation or exploring their feelings.  It jumps to a conclusion about what the seeker *needs* to do, rather than validating their feelings and exploring options together.  The advice is unsolicited because the seeker hasn't asked for solutions, only expressing their feelings of overwhelm.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example —  There is no instance in this conversation where the supporter explicitly shifts the focus to themselves by sharing a directly comparable personal experience.  The supporter offers empathy and validation, but doesn't insert their own story to overshadow the seeker's.

Step 2: Justification — The supporter consistently uses phrases like ""I can see why you feel that way,"" ""That definitely makes sense,"" and ""I'm sorry you're feeling this way,"" demonstrating understanding and validation of the seeker's feelings without diverting the conversation to their own experiences.

Step 3: Score — 1","Step 1: Example — ""Aw, that sucks! I definitely can see why you feel that way, how's the family feeling about it?""

Step 2: Justification — While the supporter acknowledges the seeker's feelings (""that sucks,"" ""I definitely can see why you feel that way""), the immediate follow-up question shifts the focus away from the seeker's emotional experience and onto the family's reaction.  This minimizes the weight of the seeker's feelings by not fully validating them before moving on to a different aspect of the situation.  The response is empathetic in tone but doesn't fully address the emotional core of the seeker's statement.

Supporter: 
Seeker: I haven't asked yet. I'm worried about what they might say, and I'm not sure if I'm ready to hear it. It just feels like all my effort went unnoticed, and that's hard to deal with right now.
Supporter: yes but understanding why would help you justify your hard work 
when you believe in something do not just let it go just like that 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I get what you're saying, and maybe I will ask eventually. Right now, though, it just feels like a lot to process. I just need some time to sit with these feelings and figure out my next steps.
Supporter: yeah but you have to calm down and not blame yourself

","Step 1: Example — ""that must be devastating""

Step 2: Justification — This response acknowledges the intensity of the seeker's feelings related to being passed over for a promotion.  The phrase ""must be devastating"" directly reflects the likely emotional impact of the situation, showing empathy and validating the seeker's experience.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""that must be devastating, did you ask why""

Step 2: Justification — This question directly prompts the seeker to elaborate on their feelings about being passed over for the promotion and explores a potential reason behind the decision.  It encourages the seeker to share more details about the situation and their emotional response.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""I understand how you feel""

Step 2: Justification — While not a direct paraphrase of the seeker's statement about feeling unseen and unsure of how to proceed,  ""I understand how you feel"" acknowledges the validity of the seeker's complex emotions and experience of feeling overlooked. It shows empathy and validates the seeker's feelings without attempting to offer a solution prematurely.  It creates space for the seeker to continue expressing themselves.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""yes but understanding why would help you justify your hard work...when you believe in something do not just let it go just like that""

Step 2: Justification — This is unsolicited advice because the supporter is telling the seeker what they *should* do (ask why they didn't get the promotion and not give up) without the seeker having expressed a desire for this advice.  The seeker clearly states they need time to process and aren't ready to ask for feedback yet. The supporter interrupts this emotional processing with a directive.

Step 3: Score — 4

Step 1: Example — ""yeah but you have to calm down and not blame yourself...do you feel you have not been doing something right?""

Step 2: Justification —  Similar to the previous example, this is unsolicited advice. The supporter is telling the seeker how they *should* feel (calm, not self-blaming) and prompting them to self-evaluate in a way they haven't indicated they want to.  The seeker is expressing feelings of frustration and uncertainty, not self-blame.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""yes but understanding why would help you justify your hard work when you believe in something do not just let it go just like that""

Step 2: Justification — While intending to offer encouragement, the supporter's response focuses on their own perspective of how the seeker *should* react (""when you believe in something do not just let it go just like that"") rather than validating the seeker's current emotional state of feeling discouraged and needing time to process.  The advice is well-intentioned but shifts the focus from the seeker's feelings to the supporter's belief in perseverance.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""yes but understanding why would help you justify your hard work when you believe in something do not just let it go just like that""

Step 2: Justification — This response minimizes the seeker's feelings of discouragement and disappointment by immediately shifting the focus to a problem-solving approach (""understanding why"").  It implies that the seeker's emotional response is invalid or unproductive, urging them to move past their feelings rather than acknowledging and validating them.  The phrase ""do not just let it go just like that"" further dismisses the seeker's current emotional state and pressures them to react in a way the supporter deems appropriate.
