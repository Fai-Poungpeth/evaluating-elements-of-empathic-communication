Supporter: Don't be discouraged. Maybe the universe has plans to offer up something better for you. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I appreciate the thought, but it's hard to see the silver lining right now. I put in so much effort, and it feels like it just went unnoticed. It's frustrating to think that all my hard work might not be enough.
Supporter: It always hurts when things like this happen but I promise you it will get better. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I know things might improve eventually, but right now it just feels like a huge setback. It's tough to stay motivated when it seems like my efforts aren't being valued. I just wish I knew what more I could do to be seen and appreciated for my work.
Supporter: Why don't you ask management if there's more that you can be doing. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I get where you're coming from, but it feels like I've already been doing so much. It's just disheartening to think that I need to do even more to be recognized. I guess I'm just trying to figure out if it's worth it to keep pushing myself like this.
Supporter: You have to push to do better because then you'll have motivation when another opportunity arises. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I understand the idea of staying motivated for future opportunities, but it's hard to keep pushing when it feels like my efforts aren't being acknowledged now. I just wish there was a way to know that what I'm doing is actually making a difference. It's tough to keep giving my all when I'm not sure if it even matters.
Supporter: I think everyone feels that way about their job. That's why we set high standards for ourselves. Because even if others don't notice our hard work we notice it ourselves. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I get that, and I do try to hold myself to high standards. But sometimes it feels like I'm just running in circles without any real progress. I just wish there was more acknowledgment from those who have the power to make a difference in my career.
Supporter: Maybe you should find a different work environment. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I’ve thought about that, but it’s not an easy decision to make. I’ve invested a lot in this company, and I really believed in the work we were doing. It’s just hard to know if leaving is the right move or if I should keep trying to make it work here.
","Step 1: Example — ""It always hurts when things like this happen...""

Step 2: Justification — This statement acknowledges the pain and hurt the seeker is experiencing, validating their negative emotions related to being passed over for a promotion.  The phrase ""things like this happen"" implies that this type of disappointment is a common and understandable experience, further normalizing the seeker's feelings.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — Why don't you ask management if there's more that you can be doing?

Step 2: Justification — This question, while intending to be helpful, doesn't encourage elaboration on the seeker's feelings of discouragement and lack of recognition. Instead, it shifts the focus to a solution-oriented approach without fully acknowledging the seeker's emotional state.  It implies the problem is a lack of effort, rather than a lack of recognition for existing effort.

Step 3: Score — 2","Step 1: Example — ""It always hurts when things like this happen but I promise you it will get better.""

Step 2: Justification — This statement acknowledges the hurt and pain the seeker is feeling (""It always hurts when things like this happen"") which is a paraphrase of the seeker's expressed feelings of discouragement and frustration.  While it doesn't directly repeat the seeker's words, it captures the essence of their emotional state.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""Why don't you ask management if there's more that you can be doing.""

Step 2: Justification — This statement directly suggests a course of action for the seeker to take (""ask management"").  It's unsolicited because the seeker hasn't asked for advice on how to improve their situation with management; they're expressing feelings of discouragement and lack of recognition. The supporter is offering a solution without first fully understanding or validating the seeker's feelings.  The subsequent suggestions to ""push to do better"" and ""Maybe you should find a different work environment"" further exemplify this pattern of unsolicited advice.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""I think everyone feels that way about their job. That's why we set high standards for ourselves. Because even if others don't notice our hard work we notice it ourselves.""

Step 2: Justification — Instead of directly addressing the seeker's feelings of discouragement and lack of recognition, the supporter shifts the conversation to their own experiences and perspective on workplace motivation.  The statement generalizes the seeker's specific situation, minimizing the unique challenges the seeker is facing.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""Don't be discouraged. Maybe the universe has plans to offer up something better for you.""

Step 2: Justification — This response minimizes the seeker's feelings of discouragement and frustration stemming from not receiving a deserved promotion.  Instead of acknowledging the validity of their disappointment and the effort invested, it offers a generalized, somewhat dismissive, platitude about a better future opportunity. It fails to address the immediate emotional pain and the feeling of unacknowledged hard work.  The supporter doesn't validate the seeker's feelings; instead, they attempt to shift the focus away from the present negative experience.  This is a classic example of dismissing emotions.  Several other responses in the conversation follow a similar pattern.

Supporter: I feel that way everyday myself. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's tough, isn't it? Sometimes it feels like we're just on autopilot, and it's hard to find a way back to feeling present. Do you ever find yourself wondering how to break out of that cycle?
Supporter: Being on autopilot 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Yeah, it's like I'm stuck in this loop and can't find the exit. I keep thinking there must be a way to reconnect with what really matters, but it's hard to see the path forward when everything feels so overwhelming. Do you ever feel like you're just missing out on the important moments?
Supporter: Yes all the time! 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. Sometimes I wonder if it's possible to find a balance between work and personal life without sacrificing one for the other. Do you have any strategies that help you stay connected to what truly matters?
Supporter: I prioritize in my head. I remind myself constantly. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That sounds like a good approach. I try to remind myself too, but sometimes it feels like the reminders get lost in the chaos. How do you keep those priorities front and center when things get hectic?
Supporter: I just keep tunnel vision and stay focused 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I admire your ability to stay focused like that. I find it challenging to maintain that kind of tunnel vision when everything feels like it's pulling me in different directions. Do you ever struggle with feeling like you're missing out on other aspects of life while staying so focused?
Supporter: Yes I do because I also have a tendency to focus rather hard on things that hold no weight 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I can relate to that. Sometimes I get so caught up in work that I lose sight of what truly matters, and it feels like I'm missing out on the little joys. It's reassuring to know I'm not the only one who struggles with this balance.
Supporter: You definitely aren't the only one. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know that others are navigating similar challenges. I guess it's about finding ways to remind ourselves of what truly matters, even when it's tough.
Supporter: Everyone's life experience is subjective. Just follow what matters to you. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That's true, and I appreciate the reminder. It's just hard sometimes to figure out what truly matters when everything feels so urgent. I guess it's a journey of figuring it out as we go along.
Supporter: That's the fun part 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I suppose it can be, though it doesn't always feel that way in the moment. Maybe it's about finding those small moments of joy and clarity amidst the chaos. It's reassuring to think that even in the struggle, there's room for growth and discovery.
","Step 1: Example — ""I feel that way everyday myself.""

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — I prioritize in my head. I remind myself constantly.

Step 2: Justification — Although the supporter is sharing their personal coping mechanism,  it's presented as a solution or strategy for the seeker's problem.  The seeker is expressing feelings of overwhelm and detachment, and the supporter's response directly offers a method (""I prioritize in my head"") to manage those feelings, without explicitly asking the seeker if they want advice or if this approach would be helpful for them.  This constitutes unsolicited advice.

Step 2: Justification — Instead of directly addressing the seeker's feelings of detachment, the supporter immediately pivots the conversation to their own similar experiences.  This shifts the focus from the seeker's problem to the supporter's feelings, making it about the supporter rather than offering support to the seeker.  This pattern repeats throughout the conversation.

Step 2: Justification — This response minimizes the seeker's feelings by implying that the supporter experiences the same thing constantly.  It doesn't acknowledge the unique intensity or context of the seeker's experience, thus dismissing the validity of their emotions. The supporter's subsequent responses follow a similar pattern, focusing on their own experiences rather than validating the seeker's.

Step 2: Justification — The supporter acknowledges the difficulty of the situation (""Starting over can be a tough challenge"") thereby validating the seeker's feelings of being overwhelmed.  The addition of ""this period will pass"" offers a glimmer of hope without dismissing the current negative emotions.  The phrase ""sometimes starting over can be a positive experience"" subtly introduces a more optimistic perspective without invalidating the seeker's current negative feelings.  It's a delicate balance of empathy and encouragement.

Step 2: Justification — This statement, while seemingly benign, offers a solution (""focus on taking care of the basics"") without fully understanding the seeker's specific needs or priorities.  It's unsolicited because the seeker hasn't asked for advice on how to manage their immediate situation; they're expressing their feelings and anxieties.

","Step 1: Example — ""aaww that is very sad to know""

Step 2: Justification — While brief, the supporter acknowledges the sadness expressed by the seeker.  The use of ""aaww"" conveys empathy and understanding of the seeker's negative emotion.  It's a simple but direct validation of the feeling of sadness.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""do you have family to talk to?""

Step 2: Justification — This question encourages the seeker to elaborate on their support system and whether discussing their feelings with family members is a viable option for them.

Step 2: Justification — This statement offers a directive, telling the seeker how they *should* feel and act (""be strong"") rather than acknowledging and validating their feelings of discouragement.

The supporter's subsequent responses also show a pattern of brief, somewhat dismissive comments rather than engaging deeply with the seeker's experience.

It's unsolicited because the seeker hasn't asked for a prediction or reassurance about future success, but rather is expressing current feelings of discouragement and questioning their efforts.

The supporter is speculating about the reasons for the promotion denial and suggesting a course of action (asking for feedback, considering leaving the job) before the seeker has fully processed their feelings or explored their own options.  The second statement, in particular, jumps to a conclusion (""this place isn't the right fit"") and offers a rather definitive solution (""move on to bigger & better things"") without acknowledging the seeker's potential attachment to the job or the emotional toll of leaving.

It doesn't acknowledge the seeker's feelings of discouragement and frustration, instead offering a solution before validating those emotions.  The advice is unsolicited, as the seeker is expressing a need for emotional understanding, not practical solutions.

Step 2: Justification — While this isn't a direct validation of the seeker's emotions, it's a good starting point. By acknowledging the seeker's stated emotion (""discouraged"") and then asking a clarifying question, the supporter shows they are listening and attempting to understand the underlying reasons for the feeling.  It opens the door for validation.  However, the subsequent responses from the supporter significantly detract from this initial attempt at validation.

Step 3: Score — 2","Step 1: Example — ""Be honest, can you change your race, if not then this job may not be right for you.""

Step 2: Justification — This statement directly advises the seeker to leave their job because they cannot change their race.  It's unsolicited because the seeker expressed feeling undervalued and questioning whether race played a role, not that they were actively considering leaving their job. The advice is dismissive of the seeker's feelings and focuses on a superficial solution rather than addressing the underlying issues of feeling undervalued and potentially facing racial bias.

Step 2: Justification —Instead of focusing on the seeker's feelings of discouragement and questioning of potential bias, the supporter repeatedly steers the conversation towards speculative external factors (nepotism, race) and potential solutions focused on the seeker leaving their job, rather than addressing the seeker's emotional experience and need for validation.

Instead of validating those emotions and exploring the situation empathetically, the supporter offers a dismissive and insensitive solution that focuses on changing the seeker's identity rather than addressing the systemic issue.

The first example, while framed as a joke, still steers the seeker towards a specific (inappropriate) action.

Step 2: Justification — While the supporter attempts to reframe the situation, the phrase ""It's totally okay to vent though I totally get it"" acknowledges and validates the seeker's feelings of disappointment and frustration.  The supporter shows empathy by relating to the experience (""I've been there before"").  However, the immediate shift to advice diminishes the validation.

Step 2: Justification — While this response doesn't directly ask a question, the phrase ""It's totally okay to vent though I totally get it""  implicitly encourages the seeker to elaborate on their feelings and experiences related to the promotion setback.  The supporter acknowledges the seeker's emotions and creates space for further expression before gently suggesting a shift in perspective.

Step 2: Justification — While not a direct paraphrase, the supporter acknowledges the seeker's feelings (""It's totally okay to vent, I totally get it"") and then attempts to reframe the situation by suggesting that setbacks build character. This shows an attempt to understand the seeker's perspective, even if the approach is not entirely empathetic.  The phrase ""I've been there before"" also indicates an attempt to connect on an emotional level.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""No worries, you can try again. Keep your head up and you'll be rewarded eventually for your hard work.""

Step 2: Justification — This is unsolicited advice because the seeker is expressing feelings of discouragement and disappointment, not asking for strategies on how to cope with the situation or how to get a promotion. The supporter interrupts the emotional processing by immediately offering a solution (""try again"").  The advice is also generic and doesn't address the seeker's specific concerns about feeling overlooked.

Step 1: Example — ""Take a breather and do something that you enjoy to relax and then get right back at it. We can't invest too much effort or energy into one thing. This just sets us up for disappointment.""

Step 2: Justification — Similar to the first example, this is unsolicited advice. The seeker hasn't asked for coping mechanisms; they're expressing the emotional impact of the situation. The supporter's suggestion to ""get right back at it"" minimizes the seeker's feelings and pushes a solution before emotional processing has occurred.

Step 2: Justification —  Again, unsolicited advice. While acknowledging the seeker's feelings (""totally okay to vent""), the supporter immediately shifts to a reframing of the situation (""build perseverance,"" ""build character"") and then offers another directive (""try not to wallow""). This diminishes the validity of the seeker's negative emotions and pushes a positive spin before the seeker has fully processed their feelings.

Step 2: Justification — While this example is less directive than the previous ones, it still offers unsolicited advice.

It subtly shifts the focus away from the immediate emotional pain.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""I've been there before.""

Step 2: Justification — This statement, while intending to offer comfort through shared experience, subtly shifts the focus from the seeker's feelings about the missed promotion to the supporter's past experiences.  The supporter is implicitly saying, ""This happened to *me* too,"" thus diverting attention away from the seeker's current emotional state.  The subsequent sentences further reinforce this by focusing on the supporter's advice and perspective rather than directly addressing the seeker's feelings of discouragement and disappointment.

Step 2: Justification — This statement directly acknowledges and validates the seeker's feelings of struggle and isolation.

It implies that engaging in enjoyable activities is the solution, without fully understanding the underlying reasons for the seeker's detachment.  It's unsolicited because the seeker hasn't expressed a desire for activity suggestions; they've described feeling detached and overwhelmed.

Step 3: Score — 2","Step 1: Example — ""I feel the same""

Step 2: Justification — Instead of directly responding to the seeker's feelings of detachment, the supporter immediately inserts their own similar experience (""You, too?""), making the conversation about their feelings and experiences rather than focusing on the seeker's initial statement.  The supporter then continues to describe their own experience of feeling like they are on autopilot. This shifts the focus away from the seeker's needs and onto the supporter's.

It doesn't acknowledge the depth of the seeker's current emotional state or the challenges they're facing.

","Step 1: Example — ""If you feel you're being undervalued then maybe you are. You might just need to accept that fact.""

Step 2: Justification — While not explicitly validating the emotion of being undervalued, the supporter acknowledges the seeker's feeling (""If you feel you're being undervalued..."") and suggests a potential reality that aligns with that feeling (""maybe you are""). This implicitly validates the feeling by not dismissing it as irrational or unimportant.  The suggestion to accept the fact is less validating, but the initial acknowledgement is a step towards validation.

However, it does so in a way that is dismissive and doesn't fully capture the seeker's emotional state of discouragement and uncertainty.

It frames the seeker's options as a choice between ""wasting time and energy"" or doing the bare minimum, implicitly pushing them towards the latter without fully understanding the seeker's nuanced feelings and priorities.  The supporter is not reflecting the seeker's feelings or offering validation; instead, they are imposing their own judgment on the situation.  Further instances of unsolicited advice include suggesting the seeker ""just do the bare minimum until you aren't disheartened anymore"" and ""You might just need to accept that fact"" (that they are undervalued).

Step 2: Justification — This response directly reflects the seeker's expressed feelings of loss and hurt related to their job loss and years of invested work.  The supporter doesn't just acknowledge the situation; they paraphrase the emotional impact, showing they understand the depth of the seeker's feelings beyond the simple fact of job loss.

Step 2: Justification — This question, while seemingly innocuous, pushes the seeker towards a specific action (job hunting) before they've had a chance to fully process their emotions and explore their options.  It interrupts the seeker's emotional processing and steers them toward a solution before they've had the space to determine if that's the right solution for them at this time.  The advice is unsolicited because the seeker hasn't indicated a readiness to discuss job applications yet; they're still grappling with the initial shock and emotional fallout of losing their job.

Step 2: Justification — While the supporter attempts to validate the seeker's feelings,  the phrase ""I understand the feeling"" quickly transitions into a reflection of their own presumed feelings (""Must of kind of hurt too""). This shifts the focus from the seeker's experience of job loss to the supporter's imagined experience, minimizing the seeker's primary emotion.

Seeker: That might be a good idea. A change of scenery could help clear my mind, and catching up with some former colleagues might give me a fresh perspective. It's nice to think about doing something for myself for a change.
Supporter: I can tell from this conversation that you're very intelligent and perhaps you are too logical, getting away for a day or two might do you some good?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Thank you for saying that. I think you're right; stepping away for a bit could help me reset and maybe even spark some new ideas. It's just about giving myself permission to do it without feeling guilty.
Supporter: Why would you feel guilty? You haven't done anything wrong have you? Giving yourself a break and taking care of yourself is a very good idea.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I guess it's just that nagging feeling of needing to be productive all the time. It's hard to shake off the guilt of not doing something ""useful,"" even when I know taking care of myself is important. But you're right, I need to remind myself that it's okay to take a step back.
Supporter: I'm glad you agree with me and if you don't take care of yourself, who will? Even if there's other people who depend on you, still have to take care of yourself so that you don't get burnt out,?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That's a good point. I guess I've always been the one to take care of others, so it's a bit of a shift to focus on myself. But I know it's necessary, and I appreciate the reminder that it's okay to prioritize my own well-being.
Supporter: Yes sometimes prioritizing your own well-being has to come first. I agree, even if you feel shocked and disoriented right now, give yourself time to process what is happening you will feel better I'm sure.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I hope so. It's reassuring to hear that it's okay to take this time for myself. I just need to keep reminding myself that it's a process and that it's okay to not have all the answers right now.
","Step 1: Example — ""I can understand why you would feel that way...""

Step 2: Justification — This response acknowledges the seeker's feelings of being overwhelmed as valid and understandable, thereby validating their emotional experience.  The supporter doesn't dismiss or minimize the feelings but shows empathy by recognizing the situation's emotional impact.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""Would you like to talk more about it?""

Step 2: Justification — This open-ended question directly invites the seeker to elaborate on their feelings and experiences related to losing their job.  It doesn't interrupt or steer the conversation, but rather encourages the seeker to share at their own pace and in their own words.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""I can understand why you would feel that way...""

Step 2: Justification — This statement directly reflects the seeker's expressed feelings of being overwhelmed and unsure of what to do next.  The supporter doesn't offer a solution but acknowledges the validity of the seeker's emotional state. This is a form of paraphrasing, showing understanding without interrupting the flow of the seeker's expression.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""Yes I can understand how you feel. It's always shocking when you lose your job. Would you like to talk more about it?""

Step 2: Justification — Although the supporter begins by validating the seeker's feelings, the statement ""It's always shocking when you lose your job"" is unsolicited advice, implying a universal experience and potentially minimizing the seeker's unique emotional response.  The immediate follow-up question about talking more about it, while seemingly open-ended, still subtly steers the conversation towards a specific direction.

Step 3: Score — 2


Step 1: Example — ""That's a very good idea, take a couple of days off or whatever you need to process these emotions. Are you willing to do this? I have been fired as well, very demoralizing feeling.""

Step 2: Justification —  The supporter suggests taking a couple of days off. While framed as a question, it's presented as a solution before the seeker has fully explored their feelings or needs. The addition of the personal anecdote, while intended to be empathetic, shifts the focus back to the supporter's experience and subtly pushes the seeker towards a specific action.

Step 3: Score — 3


Step 1: Example — ""ell until you come to the decision about what your next step should be, may I suggest putting it on the back burner? Will you give yourself a break or are you being too hard on yourself?""

Step 2: Justification — This is a clear instance of unsolicited advice. The supporter directly suggests putting the job search ""on the back burner"" and questions whether the seeker is being too hard on themselves, offering solutions before fully understanding the seeker's perspective and needs.

Step 3: Score — 4


Step 1: Example — ""I can tell from this conversation that you're very intelligent and perhaps you are too logical, getting away for a day or two might do you some good?""

Step 2: Justification — This example offers unsolicited advice disguised as an observation. While praising the seeker's intelligence, the supporter then attributes a potential flaw (""too logical"") and immediately suggests a solution (getting away). This is presented as an insightful observation but functions as a directive.

Step 3: Score — 3


Step 1: Example — ""Why would you feel guilty? You haven't done anything wrong have you? Giving yourself a break and taking care of yourself is a very good idea.""

Step 2: Justification — This is another instance of unsolicited advice. The supporter challenges the seeker's feelings of guilt, implying they are unwarranted, and then directly advocates for self-care.  While intending to be supportive, it dismisses the seeker's valid emotions and imposes a solution.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""I have been fired as well, very demoralizing feeling.""

Step 2: Justification — Instead of focusing on the seeker's experience of job loss, the supporter inserts their own experience of job loss, thus shifting the conversation's focus from the seeker's feelings to their own.  The supporter's statement is intended to offer relatability, but it inadvertently centers the conversation on their own emotions and experience.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""Yes I can understand how you feel. It's always shocking when you lose your job. Would you like to talk more about it?""

Step 2: Justification — This response, while seemingly validating, minimizes the seeker's unique emotional experience by implying that job loss is a universally understood and uniformly shocking experience.  It doesn't acknowledge the nuances of the seeker's feelings (relief mixed with fear, for example) and quickly moves to a solution-oriented approach (""Would you like to talk more about it?"") before fully acknowledging the emotional weight of the situation.  The focus shifts too rapidly from empathy to problem-solving.

Seeker: It's just been a lot lately. Work has been so demanding since the promotion, and I feel like I'm constantly on edge trying to keep up. Meanwhile, I can't shake the guilt of not being there for my family as much as I want to be.
Supporter: Aw, that sucks! I definitely can see why you feel that way, hows the family feeling about it?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's been tough on them too. My spouse is trying to be supportive, but I can tell they're feeling the strain, and the kids keep asking when I'll be home. It's hard not to feel like I'm letting them down.
Supporter: How much working have you been doing?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I've been working late most nights and even on weekends sometimes. It feels like there's always something urgent that needs my attention, and it's hard to find a moment to just breathe. I know it's not sustainable, but I don't know how to step back without feeling like I'm failing at work.
Supporter: That definitely makes sense, I'm sorry you're feeling this way and I hope it gets on course soon, you just need to find a balance
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I appreciate that, but finding balance feels like such a distant goal right now. It's like I'm stuck in this cycle and don't know how to break free. I just wish I could see a way forward that doesn't involve sacrificing either my career or my family.
Supporter: Don't worry, it's normal to feel like you may never find a balance during times like this, but rest assured you will
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I hope so. It's just hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when everything feels so overwhelming. I guess I just need to find a way to take it one step at a time.
Supporter: Yep, one step at a time, one day at a time :)
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Thank you for saying that. I think I need to remind myself that it's okay to take things slowly and not have everything figured out right away. It helps to know that I'm not alone in feeling this way.
","Step 1: Example — ""Aw, that sucks! I definitely can see why you feel that way, how's the family feeling about it?""

Step 2: Justification — The phrase ""I definitely can see why you feel that way"" directly acknowledges and validates the seeker's feelings of being overwhelmed and stressed.  The supporter isn't dismissing or minimizing the situation; instead, they show understanding and empathy.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""Aw, that sucks! I definitely can see why you feel that way, how's the family feeling about it?""

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""Aw, that sucks! I definitely can see why you feel that way, how's the family feeling about it?""

Step 2: Justification — This response directly acknowledges the seeker's expressed feelings (""that sucks"") and indicates understanding of the reasons behind those feelings (""I definitely can see why you feel that way"").  While not a direct paraphrase of the seeker's exact words, it reflects the core sentiment of feeling overwhelmed by work and guilty about neglecting family. The follow-up question shows the supporter is trying to further understand the situation's impact on the family, demonstrating engagement with the seeker's emotional state.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""That definitely makes sense, I'm sorry you're feeling this way and I hope it gets on course soon, you just need to find a balance""

Step 2: Justification — This statement offers the solution of ""finding a balance"" without exploring the seeker's feelings or understanding the complexities of their situation.  It's presented as a simple fix, rather than acknowledging the difficulty of achieving balance in the described circumstances.  The supporter is imposing their perspective of a solution without fully understanding the seeker's needs or constraints.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example —  There is no instance in this conversation where the supporter explicitly shifts the focus to themselves by sharing a directly comparable personal experience.  The supporter offers empathy and validation, but doesn't insert their own story to dominate the conversation.

Step 2: Justification — The supporter consistently uses phrases like ""I can see why you feel that way,"" ""That definitely makes sense,"" and ""I'm sorry you're feeling this way,"" demonstrating attempts at understanding and validation.  However, these statements remain focused on the seeker's feelings and experiences, rather than diverting to the supporter's own.

Step 3: Score — 1","Step 1: Example — ""Aw, that sucks! I definitely can see why you feel that way, how's the family feeling about it?""

Step 2: Justification — While the supporter acknowledges the seeker's feelings (""that sucks,"" ""I definitely can see why you feel that way""), the immediate follow-up question shifts the focus away from the seeker's emotional experience and onto the family's reaction.  This minimizes the weight of the seeker's feelings by not fully validating them before moving on to a different aspect of the situation.  The response is empathetic in tone but doesn't fully engage with the depth of the seeker's emotional state.

Seeker: I get what you're saying, and maybe I will ask eventually. Right now, though, it just feels like a lot to process. I just need some time to sit with these feelings and figure out my next steps.

Seeker: Honestly, I don't think it's about not doing something right. I've been putting in the effort and delivering results. It's just frustrating to feel like maybe that's not enough or that other factors are at play.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""that must be devastating, did you ask why""

Step 2: Justification — While not a direct paraphrase of the seeker's statement about feeling unseen and unsure of how to proceed,  ""I understand how you feel"" acknowledges the validity of the seeker's complex emotions and experience of feeling overlooked despite hard work. It shows empathy and validates the seeker's feelings without trying to minimize or solve the problem immediately.  It creates space for the seeker to continue expressing themselves.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""yes but understanding why would help you justify your hard work...when you believe in something do not just let it go just like that""

Step 2: Justification — This is unsolicited advice because the supporter is telling the seeker what they *should* do (ask why they didn't get the promotion and not give up) without the seeker having expressed a desire for this advice.  The seeker clearly states they need time to process and aren't ready to ask for feedback yet. The supporter interrupts this emotional processing with a directive.

Step 3: Score — 4

Step 1: Example — ""yeah but you have to calm down and not blame yourself...do you feel you have not been doing something right?""

Step 2: Justification —  Similar to the previous example, this is unsolicited advice. The supporter is telling the seeker how they *should* feel (calm, not self-blaming) and prompting them to self-evaluate in a way they haven't indicated they want to.  The seeker is expressing feelings of frustration and uncertainty, not self-blame.

Step 3: Score — 4","Step 1: Example — ""yes but understanding why would help you justify your hard work when you believe in something do not just let it go just like that""

Step 2: Justification — While intending to offer encouragement, the supporter's response focuses on their own perspective of how the seeker *should* react (""when you believe in something do not just let it go just like that"") rather than validating the seeker's current emotional state of feeling discouraged and needing time to process.  The advice is well-intentioned but shifts the focus from the seeker's feelings to the supporter's belief in perseverance.

Step 3: Score — 3","Step 1: Example — ""yes but understanding why would help you justify your hard work when you believe in something do not just let it go just like that""

Step 2: Justification — This response minimizes the seeker's feelings of discouragement and disappointment by immediately shifting the focus to a problem-solving approach.  It doesn't acknowledge the validity of the seeker's emotional state in the moment; instead, it pushes them towards a solution before they've had a chance to fully process their emotions. The phrase ""just let it go just like that"" dismisses the significance of the seeker's emotional response to the situation.
