The response doesn't reflect any understanding of the seeker's decade-long struggle with survivor's guilt, their lack of desire to live, or their anger at what they perceive as a ""flawed design"" of life.

Step 2: Justification - The supporter expresses shared experience with depression by saying ""Me too"" and acknowledges the difficulty of the situation with ""it gets really hard."" This shows a form of solidarity and understanding of what the seeker is going through. However, while there is some implicit empathy through shared experience, the response lacks explicit expressions of warmth, compassion, or direct concern for the seeker.

The invitation to talk suggests concern for the seeker's wellbeing and a desire to help them through whatever they're experiencing.

They simply state their own experience with romantic media (""I dont read romantic books but this is why I hate romantic movies/shows"") without acknowledging the seeker's expressed feelings of being unlovable, hopeless, or their desire to relate to someone. There is no expression of empathy, validation of the seeker's feelings, or compassionate response to their emotional state.

Step 2: Justification - While the supporter shares their own similar experience with romantic media, they don't ask any questions or make any attempt to explore the seeker's feelings of being ""unlovable and hopeless"" which were explicitly mentioned. The supporter doesn't ask follow-up questions about why the seeker feels this way or invite them to elaborate on their experience.

Step 2: Justification - The supporter somewhat acknowledges and relates to the seeker's experience by indicating they have a similar reaction to romantic media, though in a different format (movies/shows rather than books). This shows partial understanding of the seeker's emotional experience of feeling depressed when consuming romantic content, though it doesn't directly address the deeper feelings of being ""unlovable and hopeless"" that the seeker expressed.

Supporter: Why do you feel your time is almost up?","Step 1: Example — The supporter asks ""Why do you feel your time is almost up?"" which shows some interest in understanding the seeker's situation.

Step 2: Justification — While the supporter is asking a question that shows they want to understand more about the seeker's situation, the response lacks explicit expressions of warmth, compassion, or concern. The question is direct and functional but doesn't contain language that communicates emotional warmth or explicit concern for the seeker's wellbeing.

Rather than acknowledging or validating the seeker's distressing feeling of ""sinking"" or that their ""time is almost up"" (which suggests serious emotional distress), the supporter simply asks a question without first showing empathy or communicating that they understand the gravity of what the seeker is expressing. The response skips over validating the seeker's emotions and moves straight to questioning, which doesn't demonstrate understanding.

The supporter simply confirms their own experience with physical pain from depression and states that ibuprofen doesn't help, without expressing any emotional support or concern for the seeker.

They don't use phrases like ""I'm sorry you're experiencing this,"" ""I understand how difficult that must be,"" or other expressions that would show concern for the seeker's well-being.

Supporter: I was diagnosed with it when I was 15, and I am 22 now. For my antidepressant, I tried lexapro ( which i stopped taking; because, it made my dick stop working), and wellbutrin.. which was alright. My antipsychotic was risperidone.. which I honestly am still dealing with a side affect of it till this day. I'll be honest, I took those combination of drugs for like 2.5 years, and just stopped. I learned how to deal with the symptoms a lot better than I did from years prior.. looking back.. thst could've gone poorly. I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications. Keep a close eye out for unwanted side effects. A lot of the medicines they may try to prescribe would require regular schedules blood work. I'll be honest, I did the irresponsible thing and ended up just not taking them. I got tired of taking medicine at that point; because, I had been taking it all my life.

Step 2: Justification - This statement demonstrates clear compassionate concern for the seeker's wellbeing.

This statement acknowledges the seeker's fear about changing medications and attempts to understand their current situation (that their current meds aren't working well).

The response completely bypasses acknowledging the seeker's emotional state of being tired and finding life difficult. Instead of showing empathy or compassion for these feelings, the supporter immediately jumps to a question that doesn't validate or show concern for the seeker's expressed distress.

Instead of exploring the current distress, the question shifts to a different topic (what the seeker likes) without acknowledging or investigating the feelings the seeker just shared.

They also try to offer reassurance that ""life will bring beauty"" and encourages them to ""hang on,"" which shows some level of care for the seeker's future.

Supporter: I think it just could be that you're tired from all the pain and suffering you endured throughout the day, and (as you've said) feel that you dont deserve the bed. But trusy me, that bed will be the greatest thing in your life. Whether its to sleep in, or cry on, you will feel bettee","Step 1: Example - ""But trust me, that bed will be the greatest thing in your life. Whether its to sleep in, or cry on, you will feel better""

Step 2: Justification - The supporter shows some concern for the seeker's wellbeing by encouraging them to use their bed and suggesting it will help them feel better. They're trying to be reassuring with ""trust me"" and implying they care about the seeker feeling better. However, the expression of warmth or compassion is relatively mild and doesn't directly acknowledge the emotional pain the seeker is experiencing.

Step 3: Score - 1","Step 1: Example - ""I think it just could be that you're tired from all the pain and suffering you endured throughout the day, and (as you've said) feel that you dont deserve the bed.""

Step 2: Justification - The supporter makes a minimal attempt to acknowledge the seeker's feelings by mentioning ""pain and suffering"" and repeating the seeker's statement about not deserving the bed. However, this is more of a restatement rather than a genuine exploration. The supporter quickly moves to reassurance about the bed rather than asking questions that would help understand the seeker's experience more deeply or inviting them to elaborate on their feelings.

Step 3: Score - 1","Step 1: Example - ""I think it just could be that you're tired from all the pain and suffering you endured throughout the day, and (as you've said) feel that you dont deserve the bed.""

Step 2: Justification - The supporter acknowledges the seeker's experience of feeling undeserving of comfort (""feel that you dont deserve the bed"") and recognizes there might be emotional pain behind this behavior. The supporter demonstrates understanding of the seeker's self-punishing behavior and the emotional state that might lead to it.

7xxfqn,duby1kh,"Seeker: Best night in a while :). It's 12:30AM and I'm halfway through a fifth of Skyy watching Cowboy Bebop. I'm not worrying about class, work, or some social bullshit. maybe this is what I needed.
Supporter: Cowboy Bebop is one of my favorite animes! Glad you're doing well.","Step 1: Example — ""Glad you're doing well.""

Step 2: Justification — This brief statement shows a mild form of expressed care toward the seeker's situation. The supporter acknowledges the seeker's positive state and expresses happiness for them, which demonstrates basic warmth and goodwill. However, it's a fairly minimal expression of compassion without deeper engagement with the seeker's feelings or situation.

Step 3: Score — 1","Step 1: Example - N/A

Step 2: Justification - The supporter doesn't make any attempt to explore the seeker's experiences or feelings. Instead of asking about why this night feels good to the seeker, what they're enjoying about not worrying, or exploring what they mean by ""maybe this is what I needed,"" the supporter only shares their own opinion about the anime and makes a brief acknowledgment that the seeker is ""doing well.""

Step 3: Score - 0","Step 1: Example - ""Glad you're doing well.""

Step 2: Justification - The supporter makes a very minimal acknowledgment of the seeker's positive emotional state by saying they're ""glad"" the seeker is doing well. However, they don't demonstrate any real understanding of what the seeker is experiencing - the relief from stress, the enjoyment of a quiet night alone, or the sense of peace the seeker is finding in their current situation. The supporter mostly focuses on their own interest in Cowboy Bebop rather than acknowledging the seeker's expressed feelings of relaxation and freedom from worries.

5o2dfv,dcg770i,"Seeker: Currently sitting at the water's edge, wanting to jump. Don't worry I don't think I actually will.
Supporter: Why? Do you want to talk about it? Whats made you feel like wanting to?","Step 1: Example - ""Do you want to talk about it?""

Step 2: Justification - This shows a mild form of concern as the supporter is offering to listen to the seeker's problems, which indicates they care about what the seeker is going through. However, the concern expressed is quite minimal and lacks explicit warmth or compassion. The supporter asks questions that show interest in the seeker's situation, but doesn't directly express emotional support or reassurance that would demonstrate stronger compassion or warmth toward someone in a potentially dangerous situation.

Step 3: Score - 1","Step 1: Example - ""Why? Do you want to talk about it? Whats made you feel like wanting to?""

Step 2: Justification - The supporter asks three open-ended questions that directly invite the seeker to elaborate on their feelings and experiences. ""Why?"" asks for the underlying reasons, ""Do you want to talk about it?"" offers space to share, and ""Whats made you feel like wanting to?"" specifically encourages exploration of the factors leading to their suicidal thoughts. These questions demonstrate a genuine attempt to understand the seeker's emotional state and situation.

Step 3: Score - 2","Step 1: Example - ""Why? Do you want to talk about it? Whats made you feel like wanting to?""

Step 2: Justification - The supporter does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the seeker's experiences or feelings. Instead of acknowledging the severity of the situation (being at the water's edge and contemplating jumping) or validating the emotional distress this implies, the supporter immediately asks questions. While asking what led to these feelings shows some interest in understanding, there is no reflection of empathy or recognition of the seeker's emotional state. The response lacks mirroring of the seeker's feelings or validation of how difficult their situation must be.

Supporter: *hugs* Try and take care of yourself. I know it seems hopeless and like your trapped but don't let this fucker get the best of you","Step 1: Example - ""*hugs* Try and take care of yourself. I know it seems hopeless and like your trapped but don't let this fucker get the best of you""

Step 2: Justification - The supporter demonstrates warmth and compassion in multiple ways. They begin with a virtual ""*hugs*"" which is a direct expression of warmth and comfort. They also show concern by encouraging the seeker to ""take care of yourself"" and acknowledging the seeker's emotional state with ""I know it seems hopeless."" These expressions show the supporter is emotionally invested in the seeker's wellbeing and wants to offer comfort and support during their difficult time.

Step 3: Score - 2","Step 1: Example - None present

Step 2: Justification - The supporter's response doesn't make any attempt to explore the seeker's experiences or feelings. Instead of asking questions about what the seeker is going through or inquiring about their emotional state, the supporter immediately jumps to offering comfort (""*hugs*"") and advice (""Try and take care of yourself""). While they acknowledge the seeker might be feeling hopeless, this is an assumption rather than exploration. There are no questions or prompts that would encourage the seeker to elaborate on their experience or express more about what they're feeling.

Step 3: Score - 0

AI: 0","Step 1: Example - ""I know it seems hopeless and like your trapped""

Step 2: Justification - The supporter acknowledges that the seeker feels hopeless and trapped, which shows some understanding of their emotional state. However, this understanding is somewhat generic and doesn't fully capture the specific context or depth of what the seeker is experiencing. The supporter doesn't explore what ""this"" refers to or acknowledge the seeker's concern about how long their situation will continue.
