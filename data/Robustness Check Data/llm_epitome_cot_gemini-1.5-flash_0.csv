Step 3: Score — 1","Step 1: Example - ""So sorry for your loss""

Step 2: Justification - While expressing sympathy, this response doesn't delve into the seeker's complex feelings of resentment, anger, and existential questioning.  It acknowledges the loss but fails to explore the deeper emotional turmoil expressed in the seeker's statement.  The supporter offers condolences but doesn't actively try to understand the nuances of the seeker's prolonged grief and questioning of life's meaning.

Step 3: Score - 0","Step 1: Example - ""So sorry for your loss""

Step 2: Justification - While this response acknowledges the seeker's grief, it falls short of demonstrating a deep understanding of the complex emotions expressed.  The seeker is not just grieving a loss, but grappling with existential questions about life, death, and their own purpose in the face of their sister's death.  The supporter's response only addresses the surface level of loss, neglecting the deeper feelings of anger, resentment, and questioning of life's meaning.

Step 2: Justification — While not explicitly expressing warmth or compassion through direct statements like ""I'm sorry you're feeling this way,"" the supporter's response attempts to offer reassurance by implying that unhappiness is temporary.  The phrase ""it never seems to last"" suggests a belief that the seeker's unhappiness is not permanent, offering a subtle form of comfort and hope.  It's a less direct, but still potentially supportive, approach.

Step 2: Justification - This response acknowledges the seeker's feeling of happiness, but then immediately minimizes it by suggesting it's temporary.  It doesn't delve into *why* the seeker feels happy or explore the nuances of their experience.  Instead of exploring the feeling of happiness, it focuses on a counterpoint.

Step 2: Justification — While not explicitly expressing warmth or compassion, the supporter's response attempts to connect with the seeker by sharing a relatable experience.  The statement implies understanding of the seeker's negative feelings evoked by romantic media, showing a degree of empathy, even if not directly stated.  The shared negative feeling creates a connection.

By sharing a similar negative reaction to romantic media (though a different medium), the supporter creates a space for the seeker to feel understood and potentially elaborate on their experience.

The question ""Why do you feel your time is almost up?"" is neutral and focuses on seeking information rather than offering emotional support.

Step 2: Justification — The response lacks any phrasing that conveys empathy or caring.  It's a factual inquiry, not an emotionally supportive one.

I'd recommend being open in discussion with your psychiatrist about the effects these drugs are having on your body and your mood. There are quite a few drug combinations for this type of diagnosis, and it would be wise to work dilligently with your psychiatrist until you find the combination for you. Don't be afraid of them changing your meds. They aren't work anyway, so you may as well be open to working with professionals to find something that works for you and your body. I'd also recommend to try being aware as possible if the symptoms, the triggers for those symptoms, and look to grow from them even while on these medications.

I'm really lucky I didn't mess myself up by just stopping cold turkey.""

Step 2: Justification — These statements show the supporter sharing their personal experience with cyclothymia, including the struggles and risks involved. This vulnerability creates a connection and implicitly conveys concern and empathy for the seeker's situation.  The supporter's sharing of their own difficult experiences (hospitalization, medication side effects) demonstrates understanding and a willingness to connect on a deeper level than simply offering advice.

Step 2: Justification - This section of the response shares the supporter's personal experience with cyclothymia and medication, including specific details about the medications they tried and the side effects they experienced.  This allows the seeker to connect with someone who understands their situation and potentially feel less alone.

Instead of offering comfort or validation, the supporter shifts the focus to a potentially unrelated topic. This lacks the warmth and compassion expected in a supportive response.

Step 3: Score — 0","Step 1: Example - ""What do you like to do?""

This can be a way to indirectly explore their experiences by identifying potential sources of joy or motivation that might be lacking, thus offering a path to understanding the root of their overall tiredness.

However, it doesn't directly explore the seeker's feelings of hopelessness and despair. The attempt to explore is weak because it doesn't delve into the reasons behind the seeker's suicidal ideation.

Step 2: Justification - While the supporter attempts to offer reassurance (""life will bring beauty""), the initial response (""but how can you play sims when you're dead?"") minimizes the seeker's expression of suicidal ideation.  The attempt at humor is inappropriate given the gravity of the seeker's statement.  The command to ""calm down"" also lacks empathy and fails to acknowledge the depth of the seeker's despair.

Step 2: Justification - While the supporter expresses empathy (""Sorry, it's hard""), the response doesn't directly explore the seeker's specific experiences or feelings related to being tired of college.  It offers a relatable experience but doesn't delve into the seeker's reasons for feeling this way.  It's a weak attempt at exploration, focusing more on the supporter's own feelings.

Step 3: Score - 1","Step 1: Example - ""Sorry, it's hard. I hated it.""

Step 2: Justification - The supporter acknowledges the seeker's expressed feeling of tiredness and dislike of college by stating that it's ""hard"" and expressing their own negative past experience (""I hated it""). This shows a basic level of understanding and shared experience, though it lacks deeper emotional validation.

73cm60,dnpb3ft,"Seeker: Making my bed makes me feel like I have my life under control. I but at least it looks like I do.
Supporter: I can't get anything done if my bed isn't made. It's the first thing I do every morning.","Step 1: Example — ""I can't get anything done if my bed isn't made. It's the first thing I do every morning.""

Step 2: Justification — While not explicitly expressing warmth or compassion, the supporter's response shows relatability and understanding. By sharing a similar experience (making the bed as a way to feel in control), the supporter creates a connection with the seeker, implicitly conveying that they understand the seeker's feelings and are not judging them.  This shared experience fosters a sense of empathy and connection, which are components of warmth and concern.

Step 3: Score — 1","Step 1: Example - ""I can't get anything done if my bed isn't made. It's the first thing I do every morning.""

Step 2: Justification - While the supporter doesn't directly ask the seeker to elaborate on their feelings about making their bed, the supporter shares a relatable personal experience. This creates a space for the seeker to connect with the supporter's perspective and potentially feel more comfortable sharing their own feelings and experiences.  It's a weak attempt at exploration because it's more of a parallel experience shared than a direct invitation to explore the seeker's feelings.

Step 3: Score - 1","Step 1: Example - ""I can't get anything done if my bed isn't made. It's the first thing I do every morning.""

Step 2: Justification - The supporter mirrors the seeker's feeling of control and order by relating a similar personal experience.  While not explicitly stating ""I understand how you feel,"" the shared behavior demonstrates a connection and understanding of the seeker's need for a sense of control, even if it's a small act like making the bed.  The supporter shows they grasp the underlying emotional need behind the action.

Supporter: I think it just could be that you're tired from all the pain and suffering you endured throughout the day, and (as you've said) feel that you dont deserve the bed. But trusy me, that bed will be the greatest thing in your life. Whether its to sleep in, or cry on, you will feel bettee","Step 1: Example — ""I think it just could be that you're tired from all the pain and suffering you endured throughout the day, and (as you've said) feel that you don't deserve the bed. But trust me, that bed will be the greatest thing in your life. Whether it's to sleep in, or cry on, you will feel better.""

Step 2: Justification — The supporter acknowledges the seeker's pain (""pain and suffering""), validates their feelings of unworthiness (""feel that you don't deserve the bed""), and offers reassurance and comfort (""that bed will be the greatest thing in your life"").  The phrase ""trust me"" implies a caring and supportive stance, aiming to provide solace. The suggestion that the bed can serve as a place for both sleep and emotional release shows understanding of the seeker's complex needs.

Step 3: Score — 2","Step 1: Example - ""I think it just could be that you're tired from all the pain and suffering you endured throughout the day, and (as you've said) feel that you don't deserve the bed.""

Step 2: Justification - This part of the response attempts to understand the root of the seeker's behavior by suggesting a possible connection between their daytime experiences (pain and suffering) and their self-deprecating actions (sleeping on the floor).  It also directly references the seeker's stated feeling of undeservingness. While it doesn't delve deeply into exploring those feelings, it shows an attempt to understand the underlying reasons for the behavior.

Step 3: Score - 1","Step 1: Example - ""I think it just could be that you're tired from all the pain and suffering you endured throughout the day, and (as you've said) feel that you don't deserve the bed.""

Step 2: Justification - This part of the supporter's response demonstrates understanding by summarizing the seeker's expressed feelings of tiredness and self-worthlessness, directly referencing the seeker's statement about not deserving a comfortable place to sleep.  The supporter acknowledges the underlying emotional pain contributing to the seeker's behavior.

Supporter: Cowboy Bebop is one of my favorite animes! Glad you're doing well.","Step 1: Example — ""Glad you're doing well.""

Step 2: Justification — This phrase directly expresses positive feelings towards the seeker's well-being.  It acknowledges and affirms the seeker's positive experience (""Best night in a while""). The statement shows genuine happiness for the seeker's improved mood.

Step 3: Score — 2","Step 1: Example - ""Glad you're doing well.""

Step 2: Justification - While this response acknowledges the seeker's positive experience, it doesn't delve into the reasons behind their improved mood or explore the underlying feelings associated with their evening.  It's a positive affirmation but lacks probing into the seeker's emotional state.

Step 3: Score - 1","Step 1: Example - ""Cowboy Bebop is one of my favorite animes! Glad you're doing well.""

Step 2: Justification - While not explicitly mirroring the seeker's feelings, the supporter shows they understand the seeker is having a positive experience by connecting over a shared interest (Cowboy Bebop).  The ""Glad you're doing well"" directly acknowledges the positive emotion expressed by the seeker.  It's a less direct form of validation than mirroring, but still shows understanding.

Supporter: Why? Do you want to talk about it? Whats made you feel like wanting to?","Step 1: Example — ""Don't worry I don't think I actually will.""

Step 2: Justification — While not directly expressing warmth, compassion, or concern, the supporter's statement acknowledges the seeker's distress and implicitly conveys a sense of care by offering reassurance and a willingness to listen (""Why? Do you want to talk about it?"").  The phrase ""Don't worry"" shows a concern for the seeker's well-being, even if it's indirectly expressed.

Step 3: Score — 1","Step 1: Example - ""Why? Do you want to talk about it? What's made you feel like wanting to?""

Step 2: Justification - The supporter doesn't immediately offer solutions or try to minimize the seeker's feelings. Instead, they ask open-ended questions (""Why?"", ""What's made you feel like wanting to?"") that directly invite the seeker to explore the reasons behind their suicidal thoughts and feelings.  These questions encourage the seeker to express their experiences and feelings without judgment.

Step 3: Score - 2","Step 1: Example - ""Currently sitting at the water's edge, wanting to jump. Don't worry I don't think I actually will.""

Step 2: Justification - The supporter's response shows a lack of understanding.  The seeker explicitly states suicidal ideation (""wanting to jump""), a serious and potentially life-threatening feeling.  Instead of acknowledging the gravity of this statement and offering support, the supporter immediately asks ""Why?"" and ""What's made you feel like wanting to?"", which can feel dismissive and like an interrogation rather than empathetic listening.  A more empathetic response would validate the seeker's feelings and offer reassurance before asking for details.

Step 2: Justification — The hug is a physical expression of warmth and compassion.  The phrase ""Try and take care of yourself"" shows concern for the seeker's well-being.  Acknowledging the feelings of hopelessness and being trapped demonstrates empathy and understanding of the seeker's difficult situation. The final sentence (""don't let this fucker get the best of you"") offers encouragement and implies a belief in the seeker's resilience.  While the ""fucker"" might be considered informal, within the context of offering support, it conveys a strong sense of shared frustration and a desire to help the seeker fight against their difficult circumstances.

Step 3: Score — 2","Step 1: Example - ""I know it seems hopeless and like your trapped""

Step 2: Justification - This statement directly addresses the seeker's expressed feelings of hopelessness and being trapped, acknowledging the emotional weight of their situation.  While it doesn't explicitly ask for further elaboration, it shows the supporter is attempting to understand the seeker's experience by reflecting those feelings back.

Step 3: Score - 1","Step 1: Example - ""I know it seems hopeless and like your trapped""

Step 2: Justification - This phrase directly reflects the seeker's feelings of hopelessness and being trapped in a prolonged difficult situation.  The supporter acknowledges the length of time the seeker has been struggling (""almost a year now"") and mirrors the despair implied in the question.
