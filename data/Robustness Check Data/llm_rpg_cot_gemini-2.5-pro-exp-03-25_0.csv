Seeker: I appreciate the thought, but it's hard to see the silver lining right now. I put in so much effort, and it feels like it just went unnoticed. It's frustrating to think that all my hard work might not be enough.

Seeker: I get where you're coming from, but it feels like I've already been doing so much. It's just disheartening to think that I need to do even more to be recognized. I guess I'm just trying to figure out if it's worth it to keep pushing myself like this.

Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I understand the idea of staying motivated for future opportunities, but it's hard to keep pushing when it feels like my efforts aren't being acknowledged now.

Supporter: I think everyone feels that way about their job. That's why we set high standards for ourselves. Because even if others don't notice our hard work we notice it ourselves. 
Seeker:

Supporter: I feel that way everyday myself.

Seeker: It's tough, isn't it? Sometimes it feels like we're just on autopilot, and it's hard to find a way back to feeling present. Do you ever find yourself wondering how to break out of that cycle?
Supporter: Being on autopilot 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Yeah, it's like I'm stuck in this loop and can't find the exit. I keep thinking there must be a way to reconnect with what really matters, but it's hard to see the path forward when everything feels so overwhelming. Do you ever feel like you're just missing out on the important moments?
Supporter: Yes all the time! 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way. Sometimes I wonder if it's possible to find a balance between work and personal life without sacrificing one for the other. Do you have any strategies that help you stay connected to what truly matters?
Supporter: I prioritize in my head. I remind myself constantly. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That sounds like a good approach. I try to remind myself too, but sometimes it feels like the reminders get lost in the chaos. How do you keep those priorities front and center when things get hectic?
Supporter: I just keep tunnel vision and stay focused 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I admire your ability to stay focused like that. I find it challenging to maintain that kind of tunnel vision when everything feels like it's pulling me in different directions. Do you ever struggle with feeling like you're missing out on other aspects of life while staying so focused?
Supporter: Yes I do because I also have a tendency to focus rather hard on things that hold no weight 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I can relate to that. Sometimes I get so caught up in work that I lose sight of what truly matters, and it feels like I'm missing out on the little joys. It's reassuring to know I'm not the only one who struggles with this balance.
Supporter: You definitely aren't the only one. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Thank you for saying that. It helps to know that others are navigating similar challenges. I guess it's about finding ways to remind ourselves of what truly matters, even when it's tough.
Supporter: Everyone's life experience is subjective. Just follow what matters to you. 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: That's true, and I appreciate the reminder. It's just hard sometimes to figure out what truly matters when everything feels so urgent. I guess it's a journey of figuring it out as we go along.
Supporter: That's the fun part 
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I suppose it can be, though it doesn't always feel that way in the moment. Maybe it's about finding those small moments of joy and clarity amidst the chaos. It's reassuring to think that even in the struggle, there's room for growth and discovery.

Seeker: Yeah, it really is. Even though I kind of expected it, actually getting the news was like a punch to the gut. I'm just trying to wrap my head around what to do next and how to start over at this point in my life.
Supporter: Starting over can be a tough challenge. Keep in mind that this period will pass and sometimes starting over can be a positive experience
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I appreciate you saying that. It's just hard to see the positive side right now when everything feels so uncertain. I guess I'm just worried about how long it might take to find something new and if anyone will even consider hiring someone my age.

**Step 2: Justification** – The supporter uses the phrase ""I understand"" in direct response to the seeker expressing feelings of uncertainty and worry.

Step 2: Justification — While the supporter acknowledges the seeker's feeling (""I know it's tough that it feels like it was all for nothing""), they immediately pivot with ""but you shouldn't lose sight..."". This shifts the focus away from validating the seeker's current feeling of futility and discouragement, instead offering reassurance that implicitly suggests the seeker shouldn't feel the way they do because of their positive qualities. It minimizes the validity of the feeling by quickly moving to counter it.

Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's just a lot to process right now. I mean, I knew the signs were there, but actually getting that email was like a punch to the gut. I'm trying to wrap my head around what to do next, but it's hard not to feel overwhelmed.
Supporter: I can understand why you would feel that way, do I have a permission to give you some advice? Or do you just prefer to talk about it.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Honestly, I think I just need to talk about it for now. It's been such a whirlwind of emotions, and I'm not quite ready to think about next steps yet. Just having someone to listen really helps.
Supporter: Okay. Would you care to just discuss your emotions that you're trying to work through right now? Are you willing to give yourself the time you need to process your emotions?
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's a mix of relief and fear, honestly. I'm relieved that the uncertainty is over, but the fear of what's next is pretty overwhelming. I guess I'm just trying to let myself feel everything without rushing into decisions.
Supporter: That's a very good idea, take a couple of days off or whatever you need to process these emotions. Are you willing to do this? I have been fired as well, very demoralizing feeling.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this, and hearing that you've been through it too makes me feel a bit more understood. I think taking a few days to just breathe and process everything might be what I need. It's just hard to shake off the worry about what comes next, you know?

Supporter: it certainly does sound like something that you need to do? Maybe get away for a day or two? Talk to some former colleagues?

Seeker: That might be a good idea. A change of scenery could help clear my mind, and catching up with some former colleagues might give me a fresh perspective. It's nice to think about doing something for myself for a change.

Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: Thank you for saying that. I think you're right; stepping away for a bit could help me reset and maybe even spark some new ideas. It's just about giving myself permission to do it without feeling guilty.
Supporter: Why would you feel guilty? You haven't done anything wrong have you? Giving yourself a break and taking care of yourself is a very good idea.
Seeker: 
Supporter: 
Seeker: I guess it's just that nagging feeling of needing to be productive all the time. It's hard to shake off the guilt of not doing something ""useful,"" even when I know taking care of myself is important. But you're right, I need to remind myself that it's okay to take a step back.
Supporter: I'm glad you agree with me and if you don't take care of yourself, who will? Even if there's other people who depend on you, still have to take care of yourself so that you don't get burnt out,?

The supporter responds by questioning the validity of this feeling (""Why would you feel guilty?"") and arguing against it logically (""You haven't done anything wrong"").
